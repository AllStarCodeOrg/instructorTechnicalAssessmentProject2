JavaScript Assessment Rubric
CLASS DEFINITION (0-2 points)
	ONLY the class is defined. There is no additional code, such as console.logs or extraneous variables defined outside of the class in the global space (comments are OK, even encouraged üòâ!).

TEST SPEC (0-5 points)
	The code should pass all of the tests in the spec, which is provided. Partial credit is given, since each test is broken down into smaller tests. 
Compounded errors are taken into consideration. For example, if a method fails to properly return the correct number, any other test using that method would normally fail, too. However, as long as the rest of the code is in order, the error will only be counted once.

CODE STYLE (0-2 points)
	ES6 JavaScript should be used when applicable - specifically, in defining the class along with its properties and methods; and variables are defined using ‚Äúconst‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äù.
	Additionally, although optimum code efficiency is not required, novice programming quirks may count against CODE STYLE. Some common quirks include: using a condition with a boolean instead of the boolean itself (for example: if(x===true){...} instead of if(x){...}), not indenting code blocks, and forgetting to return a value in a function or method.
