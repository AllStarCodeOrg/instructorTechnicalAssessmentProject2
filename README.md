# Project #2 - Define a JavaScript Class
**Define the Pokemon class using the given specifications**

The testing spec that will be used to score your code is provided **within this repo**.
For those unfamiliar with testing frameworks, a simplified version has also been provided.

Your submitted code will be run through the testing spec AS IS. Therefore, you are HIGHLY encouraged to make sure your code works before submitting it.

### CLASS DEFINITION
ONLY the class is defined. There is no additional code, such as console.logs or extraneous variables defined outside of the class in the global space (comments are OK, even encouraged ðŸ˜‰!).
### TEST SPEC
The code should pass all of the tests in the spec, which is provided. Partial credit is given, since each test is broken down into smaller tests.  
Compounded errors are taken into consideration. For example, if a method fails to properly return the correct number, any other test using that method would normally fail, too. However, as long as the rest of the code is in order, the error will only be counted once.
### CODE STYLE
ES6 JavaScript should be used when applicable - specifically, in defining the class along with its properties and methods; and variables are defined using `const` or `let`.  
Additionally, although optimum code efficiency is not required, novice programming quirks may count against CODE STYLE. Some common quirks include: using a condition with a boolean instead of the boolean itself (for example: ```if(x===true){...}``` instead of ```if(x){...}```), not indenting code blocks, and forgetting to return a value in a function or method.
